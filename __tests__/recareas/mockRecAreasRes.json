            "RecAreaDescription": "Lud Drexler Park is located on the north end of Salmon Falls Creek Reservoir near the Idaho/Nevada border, about 36 miles south of Twin Falls, Idaho. The reservoir was created in 1910 to provide irrigation water to nearly 25,000 acres of farmland. The recreation site was developed in 1974 in response to increased use of the reservoir. The recreation site is a cooperative effort by local sportsmen, Twin Falls County, Salmon River Canal Company and the BLM. In 1981, it was renamed in honor of Lud Drexler, a local sportsman who contributed significantly to developing the site.\n\nLud Drexler Park offers 20 developed campsites with shade cabanas, fire rings, and picnic tables, irrigated landscaping and vault toilets. The Park also offers reservoir shore access, a boat ramp, maintained road access and dispersed camping sites. Potable water and a RV dump are available on site, and two camp sites have electricity. The reservoir is popular for boating, fishing and camping. Anglers find trout, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, and walleye throughout the year. During the fall season, the campground is a popular place to stay for hunters due to abundant game found near the reservoir.\n\nThis is a US fee site that currently has $5 per vehicle per night camping fee. Idaho State Park Passes are not accepted. No reservations are available, and all sites are first come- first serve. Two sites have electric and water hook ups, and a dump station is on site. While there are camp sites that can accommodate larger RV's, not all sites are RV friendly, enter with caution. Bring your own firewood as cutting of vegetation on site is prohibited.\n\nFor the first time in nearly 30 years, there is a planned fee increase for Lud Drexler Park in 2022. This will enable the BLM to improve services and amenities, ensuring the sites remain operational for years to come. The new fee structure will appear as follows for both Milner Historic Recreation Area and Lud Drexler Park.\n\nDay Use: $5\n\nOvernight Camping: $15 per site per night, to include two vehicles per site. Additional vehicles will be charged $5 per night per vehicle.\n\nAnnual Pass: $50 for unlimited day use at Milner Historic Recreation Area and Lud Drexler Park. Reduces camping rate to $5 per site per night, to include two vehicles. Available at the Burley Field Office and Twin Falls District Office in 2022. Learn more: https://on.doi.gov/3u64HKG",

Raptors nest in the canyon cliffs. The Middle Fork of the Popo Agie provides great habitat for rainbow trout.  \r\n<br><br> \r\nRecreation opportunities include sightseeing, hiking, rock climbing, fishing, picnicking, and hunting. Perhaps the most notable attraction is the Sinks itself, from which the canyon takes its name. At the Sinks, the Popo Agie River literally sinks underground and reappears several hundred yards below at the appropriately-named Rise. One of the canyon's most popular attractions, a large pool of huge trout, is found at the Rise. You can watch and feed the fish, but fishing is not allowed there.  \r\n<br><br> \r\nRock climbers come from around the world to hone their skills on the canyon's sheer walls of Bighorn dolomite. The walls' southern exposure means they're warmed by direct sunlight, providing year-round climbing opportunities. Three hiking trails lead to the base of the cliffs.  \r\n<br><br> \r\nMuch of the canyon is comprised of public lands, managed by the USDA Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and by the State of Wyoming at Sinks Canyon State Park.
