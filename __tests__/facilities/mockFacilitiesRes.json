The area contains 12 miles of trails for hiking, biking, horseback riding, fishing, bird watching and other passive recreation. There is a wide variety of terrain to choose from, including gently sloped to challenging hills, oak woodland and gentle riverfront trails. Each season offers a diverse experience.<p> The land for Cronan Ranch and river trail corridor was purchased by the American River Conservancy, BLM and other partners over a period of 16 years and placed into public trust to be used for recreation and wildlife conservation. The purchase was made possible through generous donations by individuals, private foundations and government agencies, including the Wildlife Conservation Board and the California State Resources Agency. <p> Cronan Ranch connects with the South Fork American River corridor trail that runs from Greenwood Creek to Salmon Falls.

The recreation site provides three quiet picnic and/or camping sites (each with picnic table and fire ring) in a shrub-steppe ecosystem, and with views to columnar basalt formations rising up along the opposite lake edge. Due to a declining aquifer, Pacific Lake was completely dry from 2004 – 2016, and is currently at a very low level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recreational activities in this area include picnicking, camping, horseback riding, hunting, hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, wildlife watching, wildflower viewing, photography, and natural history appreciation. Nearby is a seven-mile motorized recreation route restricted to on-trail riding only. Several hiking trails are also available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 12.5-mile Odessa to Pacific Lake Trail links the town of Odessa, Washington and Pacific Lake Recreation Site. It crosses shrub-steppe uplands, and Lake Creek Canyon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Odessa Craters Loop Trail trailhead/parking lot is alongside WA-21 just 6.6 miles north of Odessa, WA. Hikers of the 1.5-mile loop trail experience views to multiple geologic feature craters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cache Crater Accessible Trail trailhead/parking lot is alongside WA-21 just 7.1 miles north of Odessa, WA. The 1/6-mile graveled wheelchair accessible trail leads to an overlook of this geologic feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Know Before You Go:</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Beware of likely daily big temperature swings, as well as rattlesnakes, especially from May through October in this arid, hot-in-summer landscape.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sources of ground water are not always present along the 12.5-mile Odessa to Pacific Lake Trail, and when available might not be suited for human consumption, even filtered, due to agricultural run-off. Staging water jugs in advance, brought in via the motorized route segment of the trail, is an option when planning to hike, ride, or bike the entire trail.</li>\r\n\t<li>When recreating on public lands, please practice Leave-No-Trace Principles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Point of Interest:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Plentiful columnar basalt formations and other scenic views can be found within Lake Creek Canyon.

With thick forests, secluded sites and lake access, it is the most popular campground in the area.\n<br/><br/>\nLake Ashtabula was created by the construction of the Baldhill Dam on the Sheyenne River in 1944, and is situated in one of the most scenic river valleys in the region, offering visitors a wide range of recreation opportunities year-round. <br/><br/>\nSummer activities include fishing, boating, swimming and picnicking, while Ice fishing and cross-country skiing are popular during winter months.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThere is no shortage of recreation opportunities and outdoor fun in and around the lake. Visitors can swim, picnic and hike within the campground. A fishing pier is a short walk away. \n  \nThe name \"Ashtabula\" is a Native American word meaning \"Fish River,\" which suits the lake's fish population; popular species include walleye, northern pike, white bass, yellow perch and black bullhead. With seven boat ramps, three accessible fishing piers and four automated fish cleaning stations, the lake is very convenient for anglers.\n  \nNearly 3,000 acres of land around the lake is managed as wildlife habitat by the Corps of Engineers and open to the public for wildlife viewing, birding, hiking and hunting. Hunters and anglers should contact the North Dakota Game and Fish Department for seasons, restrictions and licenses; fishing licenses and bait may be purchased from concessionaires around the lake.\n  \nCampers can also reach the 63-mile Sheyenne River Valley National Scenic Byway and access nearly 35 miles of the North Country National Scenic Trail within a short drive.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThere are 41 campsites with 37 of the sites offering electrical service. Other features of the campground include a swimming beach, flush toilets, playground and hiking trail. <br/><br/>\nA dump station, fishing pier, boat ramp, restaurant and additional hiking trails are within walking distance. The nearest town is Valley City, 10 miles away.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is heavily wooded offering shade and privacy for most sites. The lake area lies amidst the 'prairie potholes' region of glacially-carved lakes in North Dakota. <br/><br/>\nSpring and fall bring bountiful views of migratory water birds to Lake Ashtabula, including the unique white pelican, which can be seen in large flocks during summer. <br/><br/>\nThe region also provides habitat for white-tailed deer, sharptail grouse, wild turkey and gray partridge.",

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nA stay at the historic Redfish Cabin is like having your own private Idaho! Nestled in the trees above the northern shore of Redfish Lake at an elevation of 6,570 feet, the historic (Civilian Conservation Corps 1930's era) cabin offers a perfect getaway for a small family or group of friends. The cabin is warm and cozy, the views are breathtaking, recreation opportunities abound and starry nights provide a gateway to heaven. And you can share it all with your canine family member. <br />\n<br />\nThe Sawtooth National Recreation Area was established in 1972 for its natural, scenic, historic, pastoral, and fish and wildlife values. Redfish Lake is by far the most popular location in the area; however, a fall or winter visit provides a totally different experience than the &quot;Cony Island&quot; atmosphere of summer. Available only in the fall and winter, this is a special time of year where few visitors come to enjoy the beauty and solitude of the lake and surrounding mountain peaks.  <br /><h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe cabin provides easy access to a variety of recreation opportunities. In the fall, trailheads to Bench Lakes, Redfish Creek, Fishhook Creek, and Marshall Lake, all within half a mile of the cabin, offer access to fabulous hiking or horseback riding. Snowshoeing and cross-country skiing on un-groomed trails near the lake offer excellent opportunities for winter recreation. Quick access to the groomed Stanley to Smiley Creek snowmobile route affords motorized recreation opportunities. Whether its photography, bird watching, climbing a mountain or sitting by the fire with a book, there's an activity for all.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nRedfish cabin can accommodate three people on a log bunk bed/futon (single mattress above, double mattress below). More people can sleep on the floor in sleeping bags (bring your own bags and pads) for a maximum of six persons. <br /> \n<br />\t\nWinter access (after November 30) is a 2.25 mile snowmobile, snowshoe or ski along the gently climbing Forest Road 214. <br />\n<br />\nThe cabin is equipped with electric lights. The heat source is a gas fireplace in the living room and electric wall heaters. The kitchen features an electric stove, refrigerator, microwave, coffee pot, pots and pans, dishes and utensils. There is no running water. There is an outhouse 50 feet from the cabin. There are picnic tables and a fire ring at the cabin although these might be buried under the snow in the winter. <br />\n<br />\nThe front porch offers stunning views of the Sawtooth Wilderness and Redfish Lake. <br /><h2>Natural Features</h2>\nNamed for the brilliant sockeye salmon that return each year after a 900 mile journey from the sea, Redfish Lake is the largest lake in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area. These fish were in such numbers that it's said the lake would shimmer red. Now endangered, most of the sockeye returning to the lake are bred in the nearby Sawtooth Fish Hatchery. <br />\n<br />\nThe 217,000 acre Sawtooth Wilderness provides the backdrop for this dramatic setting, including the peaks which frame the lake at its south end: Mount Heyburn at 10,229' (3,118 m) and Grand Mogul at 9,733' (2967 m). Known for clear air, clean water and classic alpine beauty, this wilderness is home to a diversity of wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, elk and deer, gray wolf, mountain goat, and the elusive wolverine. <br />\n<br />\nPrehistoric hunters inhabited the Redfish Lake area as early as 9,500 years ago, using the Redfish rock shelter as cover while they hunted elk, deer, antelope, mammoth, bison and, later, fished for salmon. <br />\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby small town of Stanley (5 miles north) provides a rural western atmosphere with limited amenities including lodging, dining, fuel and groceries in winter. To the south, Smiley Creek Lodge (25 miles) offers a restaurant, lodging and snowmobile rentals. Popular activities in the Sawtooth Valley this time of year include hunting, hiking, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, and hot springing along the Salmon River.",

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nAmerican Ridge Lodge is located approximately 38 miles west of Naches, Washington in the foothills of the East Cascades mountain range. The lodge is available for reservation year-round, offering visitors a glimpse into the unique ski history of the area. Larger groups and gatherings will find this spacious facility to be an ideal setting for recreation and relaxation.\n   \nIn the 1930s, the Yakima Valley Ski Club worked with the U.S. Forest Service to construct the American River Ski Bowl, one of the first downhill ski areas in Washington State. The rustic ski lodge and unique 20-seater outhouse were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in connection with the ski area, which was operated into the 1950s.\n    \nBy the late 1950s, White Pass Ski Area was built, offering deeper snow, a longer ski season and steeper slopes. American Ridge Ski Bowl lay vacant for years, until the lodge and outhouse were carefully restored and made available to the public for reservation.  <h2>Recreation</h2>\nIn the summer and early fall, guests will find excellent hiking, fishing, horseback riding, and mountain biking opportunities in the area. Skiing, snowshoeing, sledding and snowmobiling are available in the winter months. \n<br/><br/>\nAdditionally, hundreds of small pools, ponds, rivers and lakes are home to populations of brook, rainbow and cutthroat trout, as well as salmon, drawing anglers from all over. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe rustic and spacious 43 x 48 foot lodge, although largely unfurnished, is equipped with a kitchen area, counter space and benches, several closets and cabinets, and a wood stove.\n<br/><br/> \nOutside, there is a fire ring and picnic tables, as well as plenty of room on the grounds for dispersed camping, making it an ideal location for groups. There are no beds at this facility. Visitors must supply their own wood for the wood stove and fire ring.\n<br/><br/> \nThe lodge does not have water or electricity on site, but pitcher pump water is available during the summer months from Cedar Springs Campground located approximately 1.5 miles from the site. In the fall, winter and spring, visitors must bring plenty of their own water for drinking, cooking and washing.\n<br/><br/>\nVisitors must also bring their own light source. Battery powered lanterns are suggested and guests are asked to respect the facility's open flame policy, which prohibits the use of all open flame devises such as propane stoves, gas lanterns and candles, while inside the lodge.\n<br/><br/> \nSleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags are not available at the lodge, and must be brought by guests to the lodge. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe lodge is located just outside the boundary of the William O. Douglas Wilderness, at an elevation of 3,041 feet. Defined by 166,000 acres of snow-capped peaks, rocky ridges, steep slopes and hundreds of pools and lakes, this magnificent region pays tribute to wilderness advocate and Supreme Court justice, William Orville Douglas, who often explored the area on foot.\n   \nWildlife viewing is plentiful in the areas surrounding the lodge. Large herds of elk and mule deer may cross the landscape, sharing forest habitat with black bear, squirrels and grouse.\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nHikers may want to traverse a portion of the spectacular  Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) , one of the world's premier National Scenic Trails. Enjoy some of North America's most fantastic scenery, as the trail winds from Mexico to Canada through Washington state.    \n Boulder Cave Trail  is one of the most popular places in the Naches District. Visitors can walk the accessible trail along the river or explore Boulder Cave. Interpretive signs along the trail explain the geology, plants, animals and history of the area.  Horseback riding trails are within 1 mile of the lodge, and opportunities for group picnicking, hiking, mountain biking, hunting and fishing are within 10 miles.",

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nSnow Survey Cabin is located 28 miles southeast of Saratoga, Wyoming, in the Snowy Range of Medicine Bow National Forest. The cabin, located just off the Snowy Range Scenic Byway at nearly 10,000 feet, was built in 1944 and was a shelter for snow surveyors. Today, it is a unique lodging experience for guests seeking \nrustic recreation and relaxation in southeastern Wyoming.  \n\nThe cabin is open year-round and is accessible by vehicle in good road conditions. Winter access to the facility requires snowmobiling, skiing or snowshoeing up to six miles. Basic amenities are provided, but guests should be prepared to pack in some of their own supplies and gear. \n <h2>Recreation</h2>\nIn the summer months, a vast hiking trail system accessing the highest elevations of the Snowy Range extends from the cabin's back door. Hikers looking for a challenge can make the trek up Medicine Bow Peak at an elevation of 12,013 feet, or hike nearby Browns Peak or Sugarloaf Mountain.   \n\nFishing is available at many alpine lakes and streams, including the popular Mirror Lake day use site.   \n\nWinter brings deep powder snow for the snowmobiler and cross-country skier.\n <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe one-room cabin is furnished with two sets of bunk beds and can accommodate up to four people. The cabin is equipped with a propane cook stove, heater, solar lights, \ntable and chairs, cookware, and basic cooking and eating utensils. An outhouse with vault toilet is located nearby.  \n\nNo running water is available at the cabin. Guests must bring their own supply of water for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Snow for melting is usually available in \nwinter.  \n\nGuests need to provide their own food, sleeping bags, lanterns or flashlights, pillows, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash\nand food must be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.\n \nNo pets are allowed within the building. Pets must be on leash or lead outside to protect wildlife. Pet must be cleaned up after by owner.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nFrom valleys and canyons that rise steeply to jagged ridges, the Snowy Range boasts alpine lakes, wildflower meadows and a mixed forest of spruce, lodgepole pine, \nsubalpine fir and aspen. At elevations of 9,000 to 12,000 feet, it lives up to its name, as snow can fall in the area during any month of the year.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife viewing is abundant near the cabin, including elk, deer and moose. Migratory birds, squirrels and an occasional black bear find habitat in the forest as well.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Snowy Range is transected by Wyoming Highway 130 between Laramie and Saratoga. This is the Snowy Range Scenic Byway. Many campgrounds, picnic areas and hiking trails are located along its course. The small Snowy Range Ski Resort is accessible from this scenic byway as well; however, portions of Highway 130 are not completely accessible during the winter. ",

Turn onto Forest Service Road 257 and continue for approximately 100 yards to the cabin.<br /><br /> \n\nHighway 130 closes at the winter closure gate 6 miles west of Forest Service Road 257. There is a large parking area at the winter closure gate available for use called the Ryan Park Snowmobile Parking Area. Winter access requires parking at the 'chains end' closure gate and using a snowmobile, skis or snowshoes to reach the cabin.<br /><br />\n\nAccess to the cabin during the winter months can be either six miles from the lower 'chains end' gate at the Ryan Park Snowmobile Parking Area on the west side of the Snowy Range or 1 mile beyond the upper &quot;chains end&quot; gate. The Wyoming Highway Department determines which closure gate will be open or closed. \n\n\n",

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Steel Creek Campground is situated along the Buffalo River under the towering and picturesque Roark Bluff. One section of the campground offers 26 walk-in tent sites and another section of the campground offers 14 sites for those camping with horses. Half of the sites in the campground are available for reservations. Steel Creek is located about 3 miles east of Ponca, just off Highway 74.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Floating conditions in the upper (westernmost) district of Buffalo National River are extremely dependent upon rainfall. On an average year, the upper river is only navigable by boat in the spring and early summer when consistent rainfall feeds into the watershed. Some sections on the upper end of the river are technical and should not be attempted by novices. For current floating conditions, please check with an outfitter, call the Steel Creek Ranger Station at 870-861-2570, or check river gauges online at <a href=\"https://ar.water.usgs.gov/buffaloriver/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ar.water.usgs.gov/buffaloriver</a>.  </p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>The Buffalo National River flows free over swift running rapids and quiet pools for its 135-mile length. One of the few remaining rivers in the lower 48 states without dams, the Buffalo cuts its way through massive limestone bluffs traveling eastward through the Arkansas Ozarks and into the White River.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>The Buffalo River Trail runs through Steel Creek and offers great day hiking or overnight backcountry opportunities. </p>\n<p>Boxley Valley is nearby and is home to Lost Valley, an easy to moderate trail that leads hikers past geologic and water formations. Call the Steel Creek Ranger Station at 870-861-2570 or visit www.nps.gov/buff for more details.</p>\n<h2>Charges &amp; Cancellations</h2>\n<p>https://www.recreation.gov/rules-reservation-policies</p>\n",
